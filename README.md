# Go-Bookserver
### Background and Motivation
I am trying to practice creating backend services in Golang so I took the idea of writing a book server from [freeCodeCamp.org's example](https://github.com/AkhilSharma90/Golang-MySQL-CRUD-Bookstore-Management-API). I made major tweaks to it, albeit it started out the same.
I hope to continually add to this and extend the book server's functionality

### Description
A simple Golang server for books where you can create, retrieve, update, and delete books.

# Getting Started
At the moment, I have only gotten the server to work locally and am in the process of dockerizing the app.
Hence just run:

```bash
go run main.go
```
